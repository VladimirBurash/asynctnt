asynctnt is a high-performance `Tarantool <https://tarantool.org/>`__
database connector library for Python/asyncio. It was highly inspired by
`asyncpg <https://github.com/MagicStack/asyncpg>`__ module.
asynctnt requires Python 3.5 or later and is supported for Tarantool
versions 1.6+.

Key features
------------
-  Support for all of the basic requests that Tarantool supports. This
   includes: ``insert``, ``select``, ``update``, ``upsert``, ``eval``,
   ``call`` and ``call16``. ``call16`` is an old call method of
   Tarantool 1.6. ``call`` - simplifies return values of Tarantool
   procedures (please refer to Tarantool documentation for more
   details).
-  **Schema fetching** on connection establishment, so you can use
   spaces and indexes names rather than their ids.
-  Schema **auto refetching**. Tarantool has an option to check if
   "your" schema is up to date, and if not - returns an error. If such
   an error occurs on any request - new schema is refetched and the
   initial request is resent.
-  **Auto reconnect**. If connection is lost for some reason - asynctnt
   will start automatic reconnection procedure (with authorization and
   schema fetching, of course).
-  Ability to use **dicts for tuples** with field names as keys in DML
   requests (select, insert, replace, delete, update, upsert). This is
   possible only if space.format is specified in Tarantool. Field names
   can also be used in update operations instead of field numbers.
   Moreover, tuples can be decoded into dicts instead of arrays if
   ``tuple_as_dict`` is True either in ``Connection`` or a specific
   request. See below for examples.
-  All requests support specification of ``timeout`` value, so if
   request is executed for too long, asyncio.TimeoutError is raised. It
   drastically simplifies your code, as you don't need to use
   ``asyncio.wait_for(...)`` stuff anymore.
